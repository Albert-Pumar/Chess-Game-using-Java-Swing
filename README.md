# Chess-Game-using-Java-Swing

This project is an implementation of the chess game using Java's GUI interface. It uses a skeleton code (until line 210, as indicated in the code) provided in the Computer Programming class in the Seoul National University as I attended one semester as an exchange student.
The project's code contains all the basic rules of the game as well as the correct implementation on the GUI interface. To start the game, just execute the ChessBoard.java file and press the "Restart" button in the pop-up window.
